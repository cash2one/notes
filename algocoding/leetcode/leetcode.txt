004 Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find the median of 
the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

005 Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that t-
he maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic subs-
tring.

06 ZigZag Conversion 
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows 
like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibili-
ty)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of ro-
ws:

string convert(string text, int nRows);
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".
