leetcode--0004 Median of Two Sorted Arrays (c++/python)

There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find the median of 
the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

leetcode--0005 Longest Palindromic Substring (c++/python)

Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that t-
he maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic subs-
tring.

leetcode--0006 ZigZag Conversion (python)

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows 
like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibili-
ty)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of ro-
ws:

string convert(string text, int nRows);
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

leetcode--0007 Reverse Integer ( c++/python)

Reverse digits of an integer.
Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321
Have you thought about this?
Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
Update (2014-11-10):
Test cases had been added to test the overflow behavior.
