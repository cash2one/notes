The cmp instructions set the condition codes according to the differences of their t-
wo operands. They behave in the same way as the sub instructions, except that they s-
et the condition codes without updating their destinations. 

These instructions set the zero flag if the two operands are equal. The other flags -
can be used to determine ordering relations between the two operands.
