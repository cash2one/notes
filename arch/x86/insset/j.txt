jump destinations are generally indicated in assembly code by a label. Consider the -
following (very contrived) assembly-code
sequence:
1 movl $0,%eax                Set %eax to 0
2 jmp .L1 Goto .L1
3 movl (%eax),%edx            Null pointer dereference
4 .L1:
5 popl %edx
The instruction jmp .L1 will cause the program to skip over the movl instruction and -
instead resume execution with the popl instruction.

----> jmp
The jmp instruction jumps unconditionally. It can be either a direct jump , where the 
jump target is encoded as part of the instruction, or an indirect jump,where the jump 
target is read from a register or a memory location. Conditional jumps can only be d-
irect.
            # As examples, the instruction
jmp *%eax   # uses the value in register %eax as the jump target, and the instruction
jmp *(%eax) # reads the jump target from memory, using the value in %eax as the read address.

There are several different encodings for jumps, but some of the most commonly used -
ones are PC relative. That is, they encode the difference between the address  of the 
target instruction and the address of the instruction immediately following the jump. 
These offsets can be encoded using 1, 2, or 4 bytes. A second encoding method is to -
give an "absolute" address, using 4 bytes to directly specify the target. The assemb-
ler and linker select the appropriate encodings of the jump destinations.
