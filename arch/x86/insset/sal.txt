the shift amount is given first, and the value to shift is given second. Both arithm-
etic and logical right shifts are possible. The shift amount is encoded as a single -
byte, since only shift amounts between 0 and 31 are possible (only the low-order 5 b-
its of the shift amount are considered). The shift amount is given either as an imme-
diate or in the singlebyte register element %cl. (These instructions are unusual in -
only allowing this specific register as operand.)  

there are two names for the left shift instruction: sal and shl. Both have the same -
effect, filling from the right with zeros. The right shift instructions differ in th-
at sar performs an arithmetic shift (fill with copies of the sign bit), whereas shr -
performs a logical shift (fill with zeros). The destination operand of a shift opera-
tion can be either a register or a memory location.
