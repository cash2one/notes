--> ZooKeeper Commands: The Four Letter Words
 ZooKeeper responds to a small set of commands. Each command is composed of four let-
 ters. You issue the commands to ZooKeeper via telnet or nc, at the client port.

 Three of the more interesting commands: "stat" gives some general information  about 
 the server and connected clients, while "srvr" and "cons" give extended details on -
 server and connections respectively.

 conf
  New in 3.3.0: Print details about serving configuration.

 cons
  New in 3.3.0: List full connection/session details for all clients connected to this server. Includes information on numbers of packets received/sent, session id, operation latencies, last operation performed, etc...

 crst
  New in 3.3.0: Reset connection/session statistics for all connections.

 dump
  Lists the outstanding sessions and ephemeral nodes. This only works on the leader.

 envi
  Print details about serving environment

 ruok
  Tests if server is running in a non-error state. The server will respond with imok if it is running. Otherwise it will not respond at all.

  A response of "imok" does not necessarily indicate that the server has joined the quorum, just that the server process is active and bound to the specified client port. Use "stat" for details on state wrt quorum and client connection information.

 srst
  Reset server statistics.

 srvr
  New in 3.3.0: Lists full details for the server.

 stat
  Lists brief details for the server and connected clients.

 wchs
  New in 3.3.0: Lists brief information on watches for the server.

 wchc
  New in 3.3.0: Lists detailed information on watches for the server, by session. This outputs a list of sessions(connections) with associated watches (paths). Note, depending on the number of watches this operation may be expensive (ie impact server performance), use it carefully.

 wchp
  New in 3.3.0: Lists detailed information on watches for the server, by path. This outputs a list of paths (znodes) with associated sessions. Note, depending on the number of watches this operation may be expensive (ie impact server performance), use it carefully.

 mntr
  New in 3.4.0: Outputs a list of variables that could be used for monitoring the health of the cluster.

  $ echo mntr | nc localhost 2185

  zk_version  3.4.0
  zk_avg_latency  0
  zk_max_latency  0
  zk_min_latency  0
  zk_packets_received 70
  zk_packets_sent 69
  zk_outstanding_requests 0
  zk_server_state leader
  zk_znode_count   4
  zk_watch_count  0
  zk_ephemerals_count 0
  zk_approximate_data_size    27
  zk_followers    4                   - only exposed by the Leader
  zk_synced_followers 4               - only exposed by the Leader
  zk_pending_syncs    0               - only exposed by the Leader
  zk_open_file_descriptor_count 23    - only available on Unix platforms
  zk_max_file_descriptor_count 1024   - only available on Unix platforms
 
  The output is compatible with java properties format and the content may change over time (new keys added). Your scripts should expect changes.

  ATTENTION: Some of the keys are platform specific and some of the keys are only exported by the Leader.

  The output contains multiple lines with the following format:

  key \t value
 
 Here's an example of the ruok command:

 $ echo ruok | nc 127.0.0.1 5111
 imok
