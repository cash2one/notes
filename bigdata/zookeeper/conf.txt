--> Minimum Configuration 
 Here are the minimum configuration keywords that must be defined in the configurati-
 on file:
 
 -->--> clientPort
  the port to listen for client connections; that is, the port that clients attempt -
  to connect to.
  
 -->--> dataDir
  the location where ZooKeeper will store the in-memory database snapshots and, unle-
  ss specified otherwise, the transaction log of updates to the database. 
  Note: Be careful where you put the transaction log. A dedicated transaction log de-
  vice is key to consistent good performance. Putting the log on a busy device will -
  adversely effect performance.
  
 -->--> tickTime
  the length of a single tick, which is the basic time unit used by ZooKeeper, as me-
  asured in milliseconds. It is used to regulate heartbeats, and timeouts. For examp-
  le, the minimum session timeout will be two ticks.

--> Cluster Options
 -->--> initLimit (No Java system property)
  Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to connect and sync  to 
  a leader. Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by ZooKeeper 
  is large. 

 -->--> server.x=[hostname]:nnnnn[:nnnnn], etc (No Java system property)
  servers making up the ZooKeeper ensemble. When the server starts up, it  determines 
  which server it is by looking for the file myid in the data directory. That file c-
  ontains the server number, in ASCII, and it should match x in server.x in the  left 
  hand side of this setting.
  The list of servers that make up ZooKeeper servers that is used by the clients must 
  match the list of ZooKeeper servers that each ZooKeeper server has.
  There are two port numbers nnnnn. The first followers use to connect to the leader, 
  and the second is for leader election. The leader election port is only necessary -
  if electionAlg is 1, 2, or 3 (default). If electionAlg is 0, then the second port -
  is not necessary. If you want to test multiple servers on a single machine, then d-
  ifferent ports can be used for each server.  
  
 -->--> syncLimit (No Java system property)
  Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to sync with  ZooKeeper. 
  If followers fall too far behind a leader, they will be dropped.
