/*******************************************************************************
stream:
    A stream is a flow of characters (or other kind of data). 
input stream:
    If the flow is into your program, the stream is called an input stream. 
output stream:
    If the flow is out of your program, the stream is called an output stream.


The cin that you have already used is an input stream connected
to the keyboard, and cout is an output stream connected to the screen. These
two streams are automatically available to your program, as long as it has an
include directive that names the header file iostream.
Once the streams are connected to the desired files, your program can do file
I/O the same way it does I/O using the keyboard and screen.
