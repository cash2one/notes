zip([iterable, ...])
This function returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th eleme-
nt from each of the argument sequences or iterables. 

>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5, 6]
>>> zipped = zip(x, y)
>>> zipped
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
>>> x2, y2 = zip(*zipped)
>>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2)
True
