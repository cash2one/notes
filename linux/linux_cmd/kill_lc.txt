kill -l # list all the signals available

The kill command issues a TERM signal by default. The process ID list is to be speci-
fied with space as a delimiter between process IDs.
$ kill PROCESS_ID_LIST

In order to specify a signal to be sent to a process via the kill command use:
$ kill -s SIGNAL PID

SIGHUP 1！hangup detection on death of controlling process or terminal
SIGINT 2！signal which is emitted when Ctrl + C is pressed
SIGKILL 9！signal used to force kill the process
SIGTERM -15！signal used to terminate a process by default
SIGTSTP 20！signal emitted when Ctrl + Z is pressed

We frequently use force kill for processes. In order to force kill a process, use:
$ kill -s SIGKILL PROCESS_ID
Or:
$ kill -9 PROCESS_ID
