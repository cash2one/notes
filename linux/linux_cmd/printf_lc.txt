printf uses the same arguments as the printf command in the C programming language. -
For example:
$ printf "Hello world"
printf takes quoted text or arguments delimited by spaces. We can use formatted stri-
ngs with printf. We can specify string width, left or right alignment, and so on.  By 
default, printf does not have newline as in the echo command. We have to specify a  -
newline when required, as shown in the following script:
#!/bin/bash
#Filename: printf.sh
printf "%-5s %-10s %-4s\n" No Name Mark
printf "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 1 Sarath 80.3456
printf "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 2 James 90.9989
printf "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 3 Jeff 77.564
We will receive the formatted output:
No Name Mark
1 Sarath 80.35
2 James 91.00
3 Jeff 77.56
