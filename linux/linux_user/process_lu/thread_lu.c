    The newly created thread starts running at the address of the start_rtn function.

 When a thread is created, there is no guarantee which will run first: the newly cre-
 ated thread or the calling thread. The newly created thread has access to the proce-
 ss address space and inherits the calling thread's floating-point environment and s-
 ignal mask; however, the set of pending signals for the thread is cleared.
 
 Note that the pthread functions usually return an error code when they fail. They d-
 on't set @errno like the other POSIX functions. The per-thread copy of @errno is pr-
 ovided only for compatibility with existing functions that use it. With threads,  it 
 is cleaner to return the error code from the function, thereby restricting the scope 
 of the error to the function that caused it, instead of relying on some global state 
 that is changed as a side effect of the function.

 @rval_ptr
    The rval_ptr argument is a typeless pointer,similar to the single argument passed 
    to the start routine.This pointer is available to other threads in the process by 
    calling the @pthread_join function.

 If any thread within a process calls exit, _Exit,or _exit,then the entire process t-
 erminates. Similarly, when the default action  is to terminate the process, a signal 
 sent to a thread will terminate the entire process 
 A single thread can exit in three ways, there by stopping its flow of control, with-
 out terminating the entireprocess.
 1 The thread can simply return from the start routine. The return value is the thre-
   ad's exit code.
 2 The thread can be canceled by another thread in the same process.
 3 The thread can call @pthread_exit.

 在任何一个时间点上，线程是可结合的（joinable）或者是分离的（detached）。一个可结合的
 线程能够被其他线程收回其资源和杀死。在被其他线程回收之前，它的存储器资源（例如栈）是
 不释放的。相反，一个分离的线程是不能被其他线程回收或杀死的，它的存储器资源在它终止时
 由系统自动释放。

 创建一个线程默认的状态是 joinable, 如果一个线程结束运行但没有被join,则它的状态类似于
 进程中的 Zombie Process , 即还有一部分资源没有被回收(退出状态码)，所以创建线程者应该
 调用 @pthread_join 来等待线程运行结束，并可得到线程的退出代码，回收其资源(类似于wait,
 waitpid). 但是调用pthread_join(pthread_id)后，如果该线程没有运行结束，调用者会被阻塞，
 在有些情况下我们并不希望如此，比如在Web服务器中当主线程为每个新来的链接创建一个子线程
 进行处理的时候，主线程并不希望因为调用pthread_join而阻塞(因为还要继续处理之后到来的链
 接)，这时可以在子线程中加入代码
            pthread_detach(pthread_self())
 或者父线程调用
            pthread_detach(thread_id) //(非阻塞，可立即返回)
 这将该子线程的状态设置为detached,则该线程运行结束后会自动释放所有资源。

 @returns 
    0 if OK, error number on failure 

 The calling thread will block until the specified @thread calls @pthread_exit, retu-
 rns from its start routine, or is canceled. If  the thread simply  returned from its 
 start routine, @rval_ptr will contain the return code. If the  @thread was canceled, 
 the memory location specified by @rval_ptr is set to PTHREAD_CANCELED.
 
 By calling @pthread_join, we automatically place the thread with which we're joining 
 in the detached state (discussed shortly) so that its resources can be recovered. If 
 the thread was already in the detached state, @pthread_join can fail, returning EINVAL,
 although this behavior is implementation-specific.
 
 If we're not interested in a thread's return value, we can set @rval_ptr to NULL. In 
 this case, calling @pthread_join allows us to wait for the specified thread, but do-
 es not retrieve the thread's termination status.

 to behave as if it had called @pthread_exit with an argument of PTHREAD_CANCELED. H-
 owever, a thread can elect  to ignore or otherwise  control how it is canceled. Note 
 that @pthread_cancel doesn't  wait for the thread to terminate ; it merely makes the 
 request.

 A thread can arrange for functions to be called when it exits, similar to the way t-
 hat the @atexit function can be used by a process to arrange that functions are to be 
 called when the process exits. The functions are known as "thread cleanup handlers".
 More than one cleanup handler can be established for a thread. The handlers are rec-
 orded in a stack, which means that they are executed  in the reverse order from that
 with which they were registered.

 The @pthread_cleanup_push function schedules the cleanup function, @rtn, to be call-
 ed with the single argument, @arg, when the thread performs one of the following ac-
 tions:
    1 Makes a call to @pthread_exit
    2 Responds to a cancellation request
    3 Makes a call to pthread_cleanup_pop with a nonzero execute argument
 If the execute argument is set to zero, the cleanup function is not called. In eith-
 er case, @pthread_cleanup_pop removes the cleanup handler established by the last c-
 all to @pthread_cleanup_push.
 
 A restriction with these functions is that, because they can be implemented as macr-
 os, they must be used in matched pairs within  the same scope in a thread. The macro 
 deefinition of @pthread_cleanup_push can include a { character, in which case the m-
 atching } character is in the @pthread_cleanup_pop definition.

 By default, a thread's termination status is retained until we call @pthread_join f-
 or that thread. A thread's underlying storage can be reclaimed immediately on termi-
 nation if the thread has been detached. After a thread is detached, we can't use the
 @pthread_join function to wait for its termination status, because calling @pthread_join 
 for a detached thread results in undefined behavior. We can detach a thread by call-
 ing @pthread_detach.
 
 we can create a thread that is already in the detached state by modifying the thread 
 attributes we pass to @pthread_create.

 @pthread_mutex_unlock.

 If a thread can't afford to block, it can use @pthread_mutex_trylock to lock the mu-
 tex conditionally. If the mutex is unlocked at the time @pthread_mutex_trylock is c-
 alled, then @pthread_mutex_trylock will lock the mutex without blocking and return 0. 
 Otherwise, @pthread_mutex_trylock will fail, returning EBUSY without locking the mu-

 Reader-writer locks are well suited for situations in which data structures are read
 more often than they are modified. When a reader-writer lock is held in write mode ,
 the data structure it protects can be modified safely, since only one thread at a t-
 ime can hold the lock in write mode. When the reader-writer lock is held in read mo-
 de , the data structure it protects can be read by multiple threads , as long as the 
 threads first acquirethe lock in read mode.

 Reader-writer locks are also called shared-exclusive locks.When a reader-writer lock 
 is read locked, it is said to be locked in shared mode.When it is write locked,it is
 said to be locked in exclusive mode.

 As with mutexes, reader-writer locks must be initialized before use and destroyed b-
 efore freeing their underlying memory.

 A reader-writer lock  is initialized by calling @pthread_rwlock_init . We can pass a

 utes. The Single UNIX Specification defines the  PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER constant 
 in the XSI option. It can be used to initialize a statically allocated reader-writer
 lock when the default attributes are sufficient. Before freeing the memory backing a 
 reader-writer lock, we need to call @pthread_rwlock_destroy to clean it up. If 
 @pthread_rwlock_init allocated any resources for the reader-writer lock, 
 @pthread_rwlock_destroy frees those resources. If we free the memory backing a reader-writer 
 lock without first calling @pthread_rwlock_destroy, any resources assigned to the l-
 ock will be lost.

 To lock a reader-writer lock in read mode , we call @pthread_rwlock_rdlock. To write 
 lock a reader-writer lock, we call @pthread_rwlock_wrlock. Regardless of how we lock 
 a reader-writer lock, we can unlock it by calling @pthread_rwlock_unlock.

 Implementations might place  a limit on the number of times a reader-writer lock can 
 be locked in shared mode, so we need to check the return value of @pthread_rwlock_rdlock.
 Even though @pthread_rwlock_wrlock and @pthread_rwlock_unlock have error returns, a-
 nd technically we should always check for errors when we call functions that can po-
 tentially fail , we don't need to check them if we design our locking properly . The 
 only error returns defined are when we use them improperly, such as with an uniniti-
 alized lock, or when we might deadlock by attempting to acquirea lock we already own. 
 However,be aware that specific implementations might define additional error returns.

 互斥锁是为了上锁而设计的，条件变量是为了等待而设计的 
 与互斥锁不同，条件变量是用来等待而不是用来上锁的。条件变量用来自动阻塞一个线程，直到
 某特殊情况发生为止。通常条件变量和互斥锁同时使用。

 条件变量使我们可以睡眠等待某种条件出现。条件变量是利用线程间共享的全局变量进行同步的
 一种机制， 主要包括两个动作：一个线程等待"条件变量的条件成立"而挂起；另一个线程使"条
 件成立"（给出条件成立信号）。

 条件的检测是在互斥锁的保护下进行的。如果一个条件为假，一个线程自动阻塞，并释放等待状
 态改变的互斥锁。如果另一个线程改变了条件，它发信号给关联的条件变量，唤醒一个或多个等
 待它的线程，重新获得互斥锁，重新评价条件。如果两进程共享可读写的内存，条件变量可以被
 用来实现这两进程间的线程同步。

 互斥锁用于保护代码临界区，从而保证任何时刻只有一个线程或者进程在临界区执行。有时候一
 个线程获得某个互斥锁后，发现自己需要等待某个条件变为真，这样线程就可以等待在某个条件
 上。条件变量总是有一个互斥锁与之关联。

 互斥锁和条件变量可以静态分配并静态初始化。它们也可以动态分配并要求动态地初始化它们。
 动态初始化允许我们指定进程间共享属性，从而允许在不同进程间共享某个互斥锁或条件变量，
 其前提是该互斥锁或条件变量必须存在在由这些进程共享的内存区。

 We @use pthread_cond_wait to wait for a condition to be true . A variant is provided 
 to return an error code if the condition hasn't been satisfied in the specified amo-
 unt of time.

 The mutex passed to @pthread_cond_wait protects the condition . The caller passes it 
 locked to the function , which then atomically places the calling thread on the list 
 of threads waiting  for the condition and unlocks the mutex . This closes the window
 between the time that the condition is checked and the time that  the thread goes to 
 sleep waiting for the condition to change, so that the thread doesn't  miss a change 
 in the condition. When @pthread_cond_wait returns, the mutex is again locked.

 If the timeout expires without the condition occurring, @pthread_cond_timedwait will 
 reacquire the mutex and return the error ETIMEDOUT. When it returns from a successf-

 There are two functions to notify threads that a condition has been satisfied. The

 Barriers are asynchronization mechanism that can be used to coordinate multiple thr-
 eads working in parallel. A barrier allows each thread to wait until all cooperating
 threads have reached the same point , and then continue executing from there . We've 
 already seen one form of barrier--the pthread_join function acts as a barrier to al-
 low one thread to wait until another thread exits.
 
 Barrier objects are more general than this, however . They allow an arbitrary number 
 of threads to wait until all of the threads have completed processing, but the thre-
 ads don't have to exit. They can continue working after all threads have reached th-
 e barrier.
 
 We can use the @pthread_barrier_init function to initialize a barrier, and we can u-
 se the @pthread_barrier_destroy function to deinitialize a barrier. 

 If the @pthread_barrier_init function allocated  any resources for the barrier , the

 We use the @pthread_barrier_wait function to indicate that a thread is done with its 
 work and is ready to wait for all the other threads to catch up.

 The @thread calling pthread_barrier_wait is put to sleep if the barrier count(set in
 the call to @pthread_barrier_init ) is not yet satisfied . If the thread is the last 
 one to call @pthread_barrier_wait , thereby satisfying the barrier count, all of the

 turned a value of PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD . The remaining threads see a return 
 value of 0.This allows one thread to continue as the master to act on the results of 
 the work done by all of the other threads.
 
 Once the barrier count is reached and the threads are unblocked , the barrier can be
 used again. However, the barrier count can't be changed unless we call the
 @pthread_barrier_destroy function followed by the @pthread_barrier_init function wi-
 th a different count.
