The purpose of theO_SEARCHconstant is to evaluate search permissions at the time
adirectory	is	opened. Further  operations  using	the  directory’s  file  descriptor  will
not  reevaluate  permission  to  search  the  directory.None  of  the  versions  of  the
operating systems covered in this book supportO_SEARCHyet.
One  and  only	one  of  the  previous	five  constants  must  be  specified. The  following
constants areoptional:
	 
O_DIRECTORYGenerate an error ifpathdoesn’t refer to a directory.
	
O_NOCTTY If pathrefers	to	a  terminal  device,  do  not  allocate  the  device  as  the
controlling  terminal  for	this  process.	Wetalk	about  controlling
terminals in Section 9.6.
O_NOFOLLOW Generate an error ifpathrefers to a symbolic link. We  discuss symbolic
links in Section 4.17.


In earlier releases of System V,theO_NDELAY(no delay) flag was introduced.	This
option	is	similar  to  theO_NONBLOCK(nonblocking)  option,  but  an  ambiguity  was
introduced in the return value from a read operation. The no-delay option causes a
read operation to return 0 if there is no data to be read from a pipe, FIFO, or device,
but  this  conflicts  with	a  return  value  of  0,  indicating  an  end  of  file. SVR4-based
systems  still	support  the  no-delay	option,  with  the	old  semantics,  but  new
applications should use the nonblocking option instead.

O_SYNC Have  eachwritewait	for  physical  I/O	to	complete,  including  I/O
necessary  to  update  file  attributes  modified  as  a  result  of  thewrite.
We	use this option in Section 3.14.


O_TTY_INIT When  opening  a  terminal  device  that  is  not  already  open,  set  the
nonstandardtermiosparameters to values that result in behavior that
conforms  to  the  Single  UNIX  Specification. We	discuss  the termios
structurewhen we discuss terminal I/O in Chapter 18.
The following two flags arealso optional. They arepart of the synchronized input and
output option of the Single UNIX Specification (and thus POSIX.1).
O_DSYNC Have eachwritewait for physical I/O to complete, but don’t wait for
file attributes to be updated if they don’t affect the ability to read the
data just written.
TheO_DSYNCandO_SYNCflags aresimilar,but subtly different.  TheO_DSYNCflag
affects a file’s attributes only when they need to be updated to reflect a change in the
file’s data (for example, update the file’s size to reflect moredata).  With theO_SYNC
flag, data and attributes arealways updated synchronously.When overwriting an
existing  part	of	a  file  opened  with  theO_DSYNCflag,	the  file  times  wouldn’t  be
updated synchronously.Incontrast, if we had opened the file with theO_SYNCflag,
everywriteto  the  file  would	update	the  file’s  times  beforethewritereturns,
regardless of whether we werewriting over existing bytes or appending to the file.
O_RSYNC Have eachreadoperation on the file descriptor wait until any pending
writes for the same portion of the file arecomplete.
Solaris 10 supports all three synchronization flags. Historically,FreeBSD (and thus
Mac OS X) have used theO_FSYNCflag, which has the same behavior asO_SYNC.
Because the two flags areequivalent, they define the flags to have the same value.
FreeBSD  8.0  doesn’t	support  theO_DSYNCorO_RSYNCflags.	Mac OS	X  doesn’t
support theO_RSYNCflag, but defines theO_DSYNCflag, treating it the same as the
O_SYNCflag.  Linux 3.2.0  supports	theO_DSYNCflag,  but  treats  theO_RSYNCflag
the same asO_SYNC

1. dup2 is an atomic operation, whereas the alternate form involves two function
calls. It is possible in the latter case to have a signal catcher called between the
close and the fcntl that could modify the file descriptors. The same problem could 
occur if a different thread changes the file descriptors. 
2. There are some errno differences between dup2 and fcntl.*/

/******************************************************************************** 
  Traditional implementations of the UNIX System have a buffer cache or page 
cache in the kernel through which most disk I/O passes. When we write data to 
a file, the data is normally copied by the kernel into one of its buffers and 
queued for writing to disk at some later time. This is called delayed write. 
  The kernel eventually writes all the delayed-write blocks to disk, normally 
when it needs to reuse the buffer for some other disk block. To ensure consistency 
of the file system on disk with the contents of the buffer cache, the sync, 
fsync, and fdatasync functions are provided.

  The @sync function simply queues all the modified block buffers for writing and 
returns; it does not wait for the disk writes to take place.
  The function @sync is normally called periodically (usually every 30 seconds) 
from a system daemon, often called update.This guarantees regular flushing of 
the kernel's block buffers. The command sync(1) also calls the sync function.
  The function @fsync refers only to a single file, specified by the file descriptor
@fd, and waits for the disk writes to complete before returning. This function 
is used when an application, such as a database, needs to be sure that the modified 
blocks have been written to the disk.
  The @fdatasync function is similar to @fsync,but it affects only the data portions 
of a file. With @fsync,the file's attributes are also updated synchronously.

earlier, the first three often have the values 0, 1,and 2, respectively, for 
historical reasons. Also, these five values are mutually exclusive; a file can 
have only one of them enabled.) Therefore, we must first use the O_ACCMODE mask

1 when a process terminates, all its locks are released. whenever a descriptor is 
  closed, any locks on the file referenced by that descriptor for that process are 
  released. This means that if we make the calls
		fd1 = open(pathname, ...);
		read_lock(fd1, ...);
		fd2 = dup(fd1);
		close(fd2);
  after the close(fd2),the lock that was obtained on fd1 is released. The same 
  thing would happen if we replaced the dup with open, as in
		fd1 = open(pathname, ...);
		read_lock(fd1, ...);
		fd2 = open(pathname, ...)
		close(fd2);
  to open the same file on another descriptor.
 
2 Locks are never inherited by the child across a fork.This means that if a process
  obtains a lock and then calls fork,the child is considered another process with
  regard to the lock that was obtained by the parent. The child has to call @fcntl 
  to obtain its own locks on any descriptors that were inherited across the fork.
  This constraint makes sense because locks are meant to prevent multiple processes 
  from writing to the same file at the same time. If the child inherited locks 
  across a fork, both the parent and the child could write to the same file at 
  the same time.
3 Locks are inherited by a new program across an exec.Note, however,that if the
  close-on-exec flag is set for a file descriptor,all locks for the underlying 
  file are released when the descriptor is closed as part of an exec.

Amemory-mapped region is automatically unmapped when the process terminates
or  we  can  unmap  a  region  directly  by  calling  themunmapfunction.  Closing the  file
descriptor used when we mapped the region does not unmap the region.
Themunmapfunction  does  not  affect  the  object  that  was  mapped—that  is,  the  call  to
munmapdoes not cause the contents of the mapped region to be written to the disk file.
The updating of the disk file for aMAP_SHAREDregion happens automatically by the
kernel’s virtual memory algorithm sometime after we storeinto the memory-mapped
region.  Modifications to  memory  in  aMAP_PRIVATEregion  arediscarded  when  the
region is unmapped.*/
