    ICMP is an error reporting mechanism.
    In an internet, a sender cannot tell whether a delivery failure resulted from a malfunction of the local network or a 
failure of a system somewhere along the path to a destination. Debugging in such an environment becomes extremely difficult. 
The IP protocol itself contains nothing to help the sender test connectivity or learn about failures.
    To allow routers in an internet to report errors or provide information about unexpected circumstances, the designers added 
a special-purpose mechanism to the TCP/IP protocols. Known as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the mechanism is 
considered a required part of IP and must be included in every IP implementation.
    The Internet Control Message Protocol allows routers to send error or control messages back to the source of a datagram that 
caused a problem. ICMP messages are not usually delivered to applications. We think of ICMP as providing communication between 
an ICMP module on one machine and an ICMP module on another.ICMP might inform an application or a higher-level protocol about 
an incoming message.

    ICMP was initially designed to allow routers to report the cause of delivery errors to hosts, but ICMP is not restricted 
exclusively to routers. Although guidelines specify that some ICMP messages should only be sent by routers, an arbitrary 
machine can send an ICMP message to any other machine. Thus, a host can use ICMP to correspond with a router or another host. 
The chief advantage of allowing hosts to use ICMP is that it provides a single mechanism used for all control and information messages.

ICMP只报错不修复错误
    When a datagram causes an error, ICMP can only report the error condition back to the original source of the datagram; the 
source must relate the error to an individual application program or take other action to correct the problem.
    ICMP报文如果发生错误，不再报错。

ICMP封装
    ICMP报文封装在IP报文里发送,作为IP报文的payload。
    IPv4的payload是ICMP报文时,IP头中PROTOCOL字段的值为1
	IPv6的payload是ICMP报文时,NEXT HEADER 字段的值是58


ICMP传输的信息可以分为两类，一类是错误(error)信息，这一类信息可用来诊断网络故障。
另一类信息是咨询(Informational)性质的，比如某台计算机询问路径上的每个路由器都是谁，然后各个路由器同样用ICMP包回答。

IPv4和IPv6具有不同的ICMP报文格式,但是前三个是一样的,包都会有Type, Code和Checksum三部分()。
Type表示ICMP包的大的类型，而Code是一个Type之内细分的小类型。针对不同的错误信息或者咨询信息，会有不同的Type和Code。
Checksum所校验的是整个ICMP包(包括头部和数据)。message body的内容取决于type,
The message body in an ICMP message depends entirely on the ICMP type. However, for ICMP messages that report an error, 
the message body always includes the header plus additional octets from the datagram that caused the problem.
The reason ICMP returns more than the datagram header alone is to allow the receiver to determine more precisely 
which protocol(s) and which application program were responsible for the datagram. As we will see later, higher-level 
protocols in the TCP/IP suite are designed so that crucial information is encoded in the first few octets beyond the IP header.

Echo Request And Reply Message Format
+-------------------------------------------+
| type(8bit) | code(8bit) | checksum(16bit) |
+-------------------------------------------+
|    identifier    |    sequence number     |
+-------------------------------------------+
|              optional data                |
+-------------------------------------------+
For IPv4, the TYPEis 8 in a request and 0 in a reply. 
For IPv6, the TYPE is 128 in a request and 129 in a reply. 
For any value in the TYPE field, the CODEis zero .
Fields IDENTIFIER and SEQUENCE NUMBER are used by the sender to match replies to requests. 接收端把这两个字段原样发回给发送端.
OPTIONAL DATA is a variable length field that contains data to be returned to the sender.
An echo reply always returns exactly the same data as was received in the request. Although arbitrary data can be sent, typical 
ping programs store sequential values in octets of the data area, making it easy to verify that the data returned is exactly the 
same as the data sent without needing to store copies of packets. As mentioned above, the variable size allows a manager to test fragmentation.
