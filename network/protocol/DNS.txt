---->基本概念
Domain Name System :the system that provides name to address mapping for the Internet. 
DNS has two conceptually independent aspects. 
The first is abstract: it specifies the name syntax and rules for delegating authority over names.
The second is concrete: it specifies the implementation of a distributed computing system that efficiently maps names to addresses.

domain names:The Domain Name System uses a hierarchical naming scheme known as domain names.a domain name consists of a sequence 
of subnames separated by a delimiter character, the dot.DNS simply calls each section a label.

Thus, the domain name: cs.purdue.edu
contains three labels:cs, purdue, and edu. 
Any suffix of a label in a domain name is also called a domain.
the lowest-level domain is cs.purdue.edu, (the domain name for the Computer Science department at Purdue University), 
the second level domain is purdue.edu(the domain name for Purdue University), 
the top-level domain is edu(the domain name for educational institutions). 
domain names are written with the local label first and the top domain last. 
domain name comparisons are insensitive to case, so COM is equivalent to com.


---->不同类型的机器可能有相同的名字
A given name may map to more than one item in the domain system. The client specifies the type of object desired when resolving a name, and the server returns objects of that type.
For example, a given name can be the name of a host computer that has an IPv4 address, a host computer that has an IPv6 address, a mail server, and so on.
When a client asks the domain system to resolve a name, it must specify the type of answer desired.

----.仅从名字不能区分出是一个域的名字还是一个主机的名字,也看不出域名的类型
One cannot distinguish the names of subdomains from the names of individual objects or the type of an object using only the domain name syntax.
it is possible to have a machine named gwen.purdue.edu,even though cs.purdue.edu names a subdomain.

---->域名的层级管理
A machine namedxinuin the Computer Science department at Purdue University has the official domain name: xinu.cs.purdue.edu
The machine name was approved and registered by the local network manager in the Computer Science department. 
The department manager had previously obtained authority for the subdomain cs.purdue.edufrom a university network authority, who had
obtained permission to manage the subdomainpurdue.edu from the Internet authority.
The Internet authority retains control of theedudomain, so new universities can only be added with its permission. 
Similarly, the university network manager at Purdue University retains authority for the purdue.edusubdomain, so new third-level domains may
only be added with the manager’s permission.

================================= 
----> name server  name resolver
A name server is a server program that supplies name-to-address translation, mapping from domain names to IP addresses. 
Often,server software executes on a dedicated processor, and the machine itself is called the name server. 
The client software, called a name resolver, may contact one or more name servers when translating a name.

---->
A client must know how to contact at least one name server.
Domain name servers use a well-known protocol port for all communication, so
clients know how to communicate with a name server once they know the IP address of
the machine in which the server executes. How does a client learn the address of a
name server? Many systems obtain the address of a domain server automatically as part
of the bootstrap process‡. For example, bootstrap protocols such as IPv4’s DHCP and
IPv6’s NDP or DHCPv6 can supply a name server address. Of course, other approaches are possible. For example, the address of a name server can be bound into application programs at compile time. Alternatively, the address can be stored in a file on
secondary storage.

---->caching 
Internet name servers use caching to make resolution efficient.
When a client asks the server to resolve a name, the server first checks to see
if it has authority for the name according to the standard procedure. If not, the server
checks its cache to see if the name has been resolved recently. Servers report cached
information to clients, but mark it as a nonauthoritativebinding and give the domain
name of the server,S, from which they obtained the binding. The local server also
sends along additional information that tells the client the binding betweenSand an IP
address. 
Caching is important in hosts as well as in local name servers. Most resolver
software caches DNS entries in the host. Thus, if a user looks up the same name repeatedly, subsequent lookups can be resolved from the local cache without using the
network.

关于老化时间ttl
The key to DNS success arises because a server does not apply a single fixed
timeout to all entries. Instead, DNS allows the authority for an entry to configure its
timeout. That is, whenever an authority responds to a request, the authority includes a
Time To Live(TTL) value in the response that specifies how long the binding will
remain valid. Thus, authorities can reduce network overhead by specifying long
timeouts for entries that they expect to remain unchanged, while specifying short
timeouts for entries that they expect to change.
