-c  3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output
    Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. The linking stage simply -
	is not done. The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source 
	file. By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the 
	suffix ‘.c’, ‘.i’, ‘.s’, etc., with ‘.o’. Unrecognized input files, not requiring 
	compilation or assembly, are ignored.

-S  3.2  
    Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble. The output is in the 
	form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified. By d-
	efault, the assembler file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix 
	‘.c’, ‘.i’, etc., with ‘.s’. Input files that don’t require compilation are igno-
	red.
	
In general , increasing the level of optimization makes the final program run faster, 
but at  a risk of increased compilation time and difficulties running debugging tools 
on the code. As we will also see, invoking higher levels of optimization can generate 
code that is so heavily transformed that the relationship between the generated mach-
ine code and the original source code is difficult to understand. 	
	
-O1 3.10 Options That Control Optimization
    apply level-one optimizations. 
	

-masm=dialect 3.17.17 Intel 386 and AMD x86-64 Options
    Output assembly instructions using selected dialect.Supported choices are ‘intel’ 
	or ‘att’ (the default). Darwin does not support ‘intel’.
