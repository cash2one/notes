--> Installing Apache Maven
 The installation of Apache Maven is a simple process of extracting the archive and -
 adding the @bin folder with the mvn command to the PATH.

 Detailed steps are:
 1 Ensure JAVA_HOME environment variable is set and points to your JDK installation
 
 2 Extract distribution archive in any directory
   unzip apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip
   or
   tar xzvf apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz
   Alternatively use your preferred archive extraction tool.

 3 Add the bin directory of the created directory apache-maven-3.3.9 to the PATH env-
   ironment variable
   
 4 Confirm with mvn -v in a new shell. The result should look similar to

--> Windows Tips
 1 Check environment variable value e.g.
   echo %JAVA_HOME% 
   C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51
   
 2 Adding to PATH: Add the unpacked distribution¡¯s bin directory to your user PATH e-
   nvironment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause), selecti-
   ng the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button, then adding or sel-
   ecting the PATH variable in the user variables with the value 
   C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.3.9\bin. 
   The same dialog can be used to set JAVA_HOME to the location of your JDK, 
   e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51

 3 Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run mvn -v to verify  the 
   installation.

--> Unix-based Operating System (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X) Tips
 1 Check environment variable value
   echo $JAVA_HOME
   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home
 2 Adding to PATH
   export PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin:$PATH
